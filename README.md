# unit_testing

This is a simple repository dedicated to learn about unit testing with the `pytest` library.

It includes a simple calculator function, along with methods to test its functionality.

A script to include the test into the github pull request workflow is also present in ``.github\workflows\pythonpackage.yml``.
